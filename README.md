# SnakeGame
Games are always been a favorite and interesting thing to play. And one of the oldest game that we played in our childhood is the “Snake Game”. It is 
the same as just like you played it elsewhere. You have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake. And once the snake touches itself it’s the games 
ended. We are recording your highest score to beat up and make it more competitive. Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. 
Every time the snake eats the food, its length will by increased by one element along with the score. This is small & simple C Programming application for 
game lovers & programming fresher’s. One of the best part of this game is this game never gets old. Even in this generation we can see people implementing new version 
of the same game in many different ways. Using C program we tried to create something exactly like this. Tried to provide the best experience people can utilize through
console gaming. Every steps were include here. We also tried to implement many other feature like high score tracker, leaderboard, level panel to make this game more interesting and motivating. Tried to build the best version 
possible to create the game in a console board.
